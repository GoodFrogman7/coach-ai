## Today's Focus

**Your Top 2 Priorities:**

1. **[Load]** Coil your hips more during the loading phase. This is where you store energy for the shot.

2. **Keep your right elbow closer to your body** for better stability. Think 'compact arms' through the stroke.

*Primary issue: Hip Rotation (deviation: 88.5°) in load phase*

## Movement Quality & Consistency

This section analyzes the smoothness and repeatability of your technique across the stroke timeline.

### Phase-Weighted Technique Score

**Overall Quality Score: 59.9/100**

*This score weights contact (35%) and follow-through (25%) more heavily than preparation (15%) and load (25%), reflecting their biomechanical importance.*

### Consistency Analysis

Lower values indicate more repeatable, controlled movement. Higher values suggest instability or timing issues.

#### Preparation Phase

| Metric | Your Consistency | Pro Consistency | Rating |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Hip Rotation | 1.47° | 1.55° | ✓ Excellent |
| Left Elbow | 0.81° | 2.53° | ✓ Excellent |
| Right Elbow | 4.64° | 3.25° | ~ Good |
| Left Knee | 1.72° | 3.17° | ✓ Excellent |
| Right Knee | 0.29° | 2.61° | ✓ Excellent |

#### Load Phase

| Metric | Your Consistency | Pro Consistency | Rating |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Hip Rotation | 135.23° | 180.18° | ✗ Inconsistent |
| Left Elbow | 7.47° | 1.85° | ○ Fair |
| Right Elbow | 6.81° | 2.17° | ○ Fair |
| Left Knee | 3.34° | 2.02° | ~ Good |
| Right Knee | 7.84° | 2.00° | ○ Fair |

#### Contact Phase

| Metric | Your Consistency | Pro Consistency | Rating |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Hip Rotation | 11.60° | 2.19° | ✗ Inconsistent |
| Left Elbow | 58.72° | 57.95° | ✗ Inconsistent |
| Right Elbow | 73.71° | 15.98° | ✗ Inconsistent |
| Left Knee | 4.76° | 1.87° | ~ Good |
| Right Knee | 4.53° | 1.28° | ~ Good |

#### Follow-through Phase

| Metric | Your Consistency | Pro Consistency | Rating |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Hip Rotation | 0.77° | 168.02° | ✓ Excellent |
| Left Elbow | 1.29° | 31.71° | ✓ Excellent |
| Right Elbow | 2.30° | 30.62° | ✓ Excellent |
| Left Knee | 0.27° | 1.84° | ✓ Excellent |
| Right Knee | 0.64° | 2.92° | ✓ Excellent |

**Consistency Guide:**
- ✓ Excellent (< 3°): Very stable, professional-level control
- ~ Good (3-6°): Solid technique, minor variations
- ○ Fair (6-10°): Moderate inconsistency, work on timing
- ✗ Inconsistent (> 10°): Significant instability, focus on fundamentals

## ML-Based Technique Similarity

This section uses machine learning (cosine similarity) to measure how closely your movement pattern matches the professional technique, independent of absolute metric values.

**Overall ML Similarity: 50.0/100**

*Significant differences - technique diverges from professional pattern*

### How to Interpret These Scores

**What it measures:** Cosine similarity analyzes the *shape* and *pattern* of your technique by comparing 9 biomechanical features (shoulder/elbow/knee angles, hip rotation, spine lean, stance width) across each movement phase.

**What the numbers mean:**
- **85-100**: Excellent pattern match - your technique follows the same biomechanical pattern as the pro
- **70-84**: Good similarity - overall pattern is correct with some refinements needed
- **55-69**: Moderate similarity - technique shows partial alignment but significant differences remain
- **Below 55**: Substantial differences - movement pattern diverges from professional technique

**Key insight:** Unlike rule-based scoring (which measures specific angle deviations), ML similarity captures the *overall coordination pattern*. A high ML score means your body segments move in similar relationships to each other, even if absolute angles differ.

### Phase-by-Phase ML Similarity

- **Preparation**: 50.0/100 ✗ Needs Work
- **Load**: 50.0/100 ✗ Needs Work
- **Contact**: 50.0/100 ✗ Needs Work
- **Follow-through**: 50.0/100 ✗ Needs Work

## All Coaching Cues

Here's the complete list of areas to work on, ranked by priority:

1. **[Load]** Coil your hips more during the loading phase. This is where you store energy for the shot.

2. **Keep your right elbow closer to your body** for better stability. Think 'compact arms' through the stroke.

3. **[Preparation]** Set up with a wider base from the start. Narrow stance limits power generation.

4. **Bend your left elbow more** at contact. Your arm is too straight, reducing control and power transfer.

5. **Rotate your hips more** into the shot. Your upper body is doing most of the work—engage those hips!

---

## Suggested Drills

Try these drills to address the areas we identified:

### Drill 1

**Medicine Ball Rotational Throws**: Stand sideways to a wall, holding a medicine ball (4-8 lbs). Rotate your hips and core explosively to throw the ball against the wall. Catch and repeat. Do 2 sets of 10 each side to build rotational power.

### Drill 2

**Ladder Footwork Drill**: Use an agility ladder (or tape lines). Practice split-stepping into your backhand stance, focusing on consistent foot spacing. Hit shadow strokes at each stop. 5 minutes daily improves footwork consistency.

---

## Final Thoughts

Remember: improvement takes time and consistent practice. Focus on one or two cues at a time rather than trying to fix everything at once. Film yourself regularly to track progress.

Keep grinding—your backhand is going to be a weapon!
