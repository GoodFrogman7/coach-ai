## Today's Focus

**Your Top 2 Priorities:**

1. **[Load]** Coil your hips more during the loading phase. This is where you store energy for the shot.

2. **Keep your right elbow closer to your body** for better stability. Think 'compact arms' through the stroke.

*Primary issue: Hip Rotation (deviation: 88.5°) in load phase*

## All Coaching Cues

Here's the complete list of areas to work on, ranked by priority:

1. **[Load]** Coil your hips more during the loading phase. This is where you store energy for the shot.

2. **Keep your right elbow closer to your body** for better stability. Think 'compact arms' through the stroke.

3. **[Preparation]** Set up with a wider base from the start. Narrow stance limits power generation.

4. **Bend your left elbow more** at contact. Your arm is too straight, reducing control and power transfer.

5. **Rotate your hips more** into the shot. Your upper body is doing most of the work—engage those hips!

## Suggested Drills

Try these drills to address the areas we identified:

### Drill 1

**Medicine Ball Rotational Throws**: Stand sideways to a wall, holding a medicine ball (4-8 lbs). Rotate your hips and core explosively to throw the ball against the wall. Catch and repeat. Do 2 sets of 10 each side to build rotational power.

### Drill 2

**Ladder Footwork Drill**: Use an agility ladder (or tape lines). Practice split-stepping into your backhand stance, focusing on consistent foot spacing. Hit shadow strokes at each stop. 5 minutes daily improves footwork consistency.

## Final Thoughts

Remember: improvement takes time and consistent practice. Focus on one or two cues at a time rather than trying to fix everything at once. Film yourself regularly to track progress.

Keep grinding—your backhand is going to be a weapon!
