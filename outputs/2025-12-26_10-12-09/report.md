## 🤖 ML-Based Technique Similarity

This section uses machine learning (cosine similarity) to measure how closely your movement pattern matches the professional technique, independent of absolute metric values.

**Overall ML Similarity: 50.0/100**

*Significant differences - technique diverges from professional pattern*

### How to Interpret These Scores

**What it measures:** Cosine similarity analyzes the *shape* and *pattern* of your technique by comparing 9 biomechanical features (shoulder/elbow/knee angles, hip rotation, spine lean, stance width) across each movement phase.

**What the numbers mean:**
- **85-100**: Excellent pattern match - your technique follows the same biomechanical pattern as the pro
- **70-84**: Good similarity - overall pattern is correct with some refinements needed
- **55-69**: Moderate similarity - technique shows partial alignment but significant differences remain
- **Below 55**: Substantial differences - movement pattern diverges from professional technique

**Key insight:** Unlike rule-based scoring (which measures specific angle deviations), ML similarity captures the *overall coordination pattern*. A high ML score means your body segments move in similar relationships to each other, even if absolute angles differ.

### Phase-by-Phase ML Similarity

- **Preparation**: 50.0/100 ✗ Needs Work
- **Load**: 50.0/100 ✗ Needs Work
- **Contact**: 50.0/100 ✗ Needs Work
- **Follow-through**: 50.0/100 ✗ Needs Work

## 📝 All Coaching Cues

Here's the complete list of areas to work on, ranked by priority:

1. **[Load]** Coil your hips more during the loading phase. This is where you store energy for the shot.

2. **Keep your right elbow closer to your body** for better stability. Think 'compact arms' through the stroke.

3. **[Preparation]** Set up with a wider base from the start. Narrow stance limits power generation.

4. **Bend your left elbow more** at contact. Your arm is too straight, reducing control and power transfer.

5. **Rotate your hips more** into the shot. Your upper body is doing most of the work—engage those hips!

---

## 💪 Suggested Drills

Try these drills to address the areas we identified:

### Drill 1

**Medicine Ball Rotational Throws**: Stand sideways to a wall, holding a medicine ball (4-8 lbs). Rotate your hips and core explosively to throw the ball against the wall. Catch and repeat. Do 2 sets of 10 each side to build rotational power.

### Drill 2

**Ladder Footwork Drill**: Use an agility ladder (or tape lines). Practice split-stepping into your backhand stance, focusing on consistent foot spacing. Hit shadow strokes at each stop. 5 minutes daily improves footwork consistency.

---

## 🔍 System Reliability & Confidence Analysis

This section provides insight into measurement quality and technique stability during your session.

### What This Means

**Measurement Reliability** assesses how consistent and trustworthy each biomechanical measurement is throughout your stroke. High reliability means the system tracked that metric accurately with minimal noise.

**Intra-Phase Stability** measures how consistent your technique is within each movement phase. Higher stability indicates better technique repeatability.

### Measurement Reliability

**✓ High Reliability** - Very stable measurements:
- **Left Knee Angle**: 6.1° std dev
- **Spine Lean**: 2.9° std dev

**~ Medium Reliability** - Moderate variation:
- **Right Shoulder Angle**: 15.7° std dev
- **Right Knee Angle**: 12.8° std dev

**✗ Lower Reliability** - Higher variation (may indicate dynamic movement or measurement noise):
- **Left Shoulder Angle**: 36.2° std dev
- **Left Elbow Angle**: 41.0° std dev
- **Right Elbow Angle**: 58.8° std dev
- **Hip Rotation**: 88.3° std dev
- **Stance Width Normalized**: 4.6° std dev

### Technique Stability by Phase

Stability scores indicate how consistent your biomechanics are within each phase (0-100, higher is better):

- **Preparation**: 94.2/100 ✓ Excellent
- **Load**: 81.7/100 ✓ Good
- **Contact**: 53.3/100 ○ Variable
- **Follow-through**: 96.7/100 ✓ Excellent

### Interpretation Guide

**High Reliability Metrics**: These measurements are trustworthy and can be used confidently for technique analysis.

**Medium Reliability Metrics**: Acceptable for analysis but may have some natural variation due to dynamic movement.

**Lower Reliability Metrics**: Use with caution - high variation may be due to:
- Rapid dynamic movement (natural in sports)
- Camera angle or lighting issues
- Occlusion of body landmarks
- Actual technique inconsistency

**Stability Scores**:
- **90-100**: Highly repeatable technique within the phase
- **75-89**: Good consistency with minor variations
- **60-74**: Moderate consistency - some refinement possible
- **<60**: Variable technique - focus on consistency

## 💭 Final Thoughts

Remember: improvement takes time and consistent practice. Focus on one or two cues at a time rather than trying to fix everything at once. Film yourself regularly to track progress.

Keep grinding—your backhand is going to be a weapon!
